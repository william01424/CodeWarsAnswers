# Lost Without a Map! (name of problem)
# Given an array of integers, return a new array with each value doubled.

# For example:

# [1, 2, 3] --> [2, 4, 6]

# For the beginner, try to use the map method - it comes in very handy quite a lot so is a good one to know.

def maps(a):    # This was my method for this problem, see below for map() function.
    newlist = []
    for x in a:
        newlist.append(x*2)   # For each index of list a, times by 2 and append to newlist
    return newlist
    
def maps2(b):                                        # See this method - I tried this but failed syntax so I moved to other method. 
    return [2*x for x in b]                         # Needed sq brackets around list comprehension to tell comp to print to new list.
    
def maps3(a):
    return map(lambda x:2*x, a)   # Using map() function
